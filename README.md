# Interview Task

There is no complex configuration in setting up this sample code.
All you have to do is:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern broswer.
3. You can check the output.

I implemented the task using only HTML, CSS and Javascript along with thrid party libraries:

- Bootstrap 4
- FontAwesome
- Tempus Domininus (A Bootstrap 4 Date Time Picker Library, along with its dependency `moment.js`)
- Bluebird (I thinnk it wasn't used)
- Axios
- lodash
